# Simple CSS only hover/click events

Understanding the right tools for the job is crucial and can make things less complicated. Specially
for Web Development. This is more true than ever now that we have `:has()` selector.

This repo holds a collection of `CSS only hover/click 'events' without JavaScript`. I have encouraged students to use and squeeze as much CSS as possible before using any JavaScript. Therefore, you can find multiple
`:hover`, `:focus` (simulating click events) and `:has()` (WIP) selectors
to be used instead of defaulting to JavaScript.
